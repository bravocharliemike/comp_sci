Comments at the start of the file to provide
important metadata such as your name and student number, and perhaps a brief summary of the program

Comments to summarise the purpose/functionality of any functions you define (these should be located
where the function definition is in your code)
Comments to summarise/delimit the main "sections" of your code, allowing a reader to rapidly identify or
find the part of your program that they are interested in
Comments to summarise/explain any particularly complex or confusing lines of code.  Ideally you should write
code to be as clear and elegant as possible, but sometimes a line or section of code gets tricky,
so an explanation helps
