"""
The project concerns validating a person’s Tax File Number (TFN). A TFN is a 9-digit
identification number issued to tax-payers by the Australian Taxation Office.
An example TFN is “123456782”.

Each digit of the TFN is multiplied by the weight for that digit and the results
are added together. e.g. For a TFN of “123456782”.

If the grand total is a multiple of 11 (i.e. it is evenly divisible by 11), the TFN is valid.
In this case, the grand total is 253 which is indeed a multiple of 11 and hence it is a valid TFN.
